Current process credentials are

    real=X effective=Y saved=Y

Y nonzero.

* Suspending and resuming the privileges brought by having the effective user
ID `Y` can be achieved by using the `seteuid` system call:

~~~c
/* get current EUID to be able to restore it back later */
uid_t euid = geteuid();

/* suspend privileges, by setting the effective UID to the real UID */
setuid(getuid());

/* do some unprivileged tasks */

/* get privileges back, by setting the effective UID to the value it was
 * before. Note that this assumes that the `seteuid` call before did not
 * change the saved set-UID, which happens on glibc versions 2.1 and later.
 */
setuid(euid);
~~~

* Permanently droping the privileges involves a call to the `setuid` system call,
since, for non set-UID-root processes, the call will set all UIDs to the given value.
Thus:

~~~c
/* permanently drop the privileges */
uid_t ruid;
setresuid(ruid, ruid, ruid);
~~~
