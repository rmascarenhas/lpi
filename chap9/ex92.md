Process credentials:

    real=0 effective=1000 saved=1000 file-system=1000

**Is it privileged?**

It is not, but it can become. A process with the above credentials would fail to
perform an operation restricted to privileged processes, but, at any time, it could
change its effective UID to the root ID with

~~~c
seteuid(0);
~~~

and then become privileged.
