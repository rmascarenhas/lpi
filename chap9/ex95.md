Current process credentials:

    real=X effective=0 saved=0

* Suspending the privileges and setting then back later:

~~~c
/* drop privileges by setting the effective UID to the real UID */
seteuid(getuid());

/* do some unprivileged work */

/* get privileges back. See comments on `seteuid` on previous exercise. */
seteuid(0);
~~~

* Permanently dropping privileges

~~~c
/* if the caller is root, or the process is set-UID-root, the the `setuid`
 * system call will set all UIDs to the given value, and thus permanently
 * dropping privileges
 */
setuid(getuid());
